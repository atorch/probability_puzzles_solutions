# probability_puzzles_solutions

This repo contains R simulations for checking solutions to (some of) the probability puzzles
in [my android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atorch.statspuzzles).

For example, [outrageous/puzzle_01.R](outrageous/puzzle_01.R) is a simulation checking the
solution to [this puzzle](https://github.com/atorch/probability_puzzles/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L636-L637).
